# You just have to Learn Theory and basic operations of.

# DS

    1. Array
    2. Linked List (Search, Insert, Delete), Singular, Dubbly Linked List
    3. Stack (FIFO, POP, PUSH)
    4. Queues (Rabbit MQ)
    5. Hash Map (CRUD)
    6. Trees (BST is IMP)
    7. Heap
    8. Graphs
    9. Strings

# ALGO

    1. Sorting Algo.

1. Array -> crud, search
2. Linked List -> (singly, doubly, circular) crud, search, insertion, deletion
3. Stack -> crud, pop(), push()
4. Queue -> crud, enqueue(), dequeue()
5. Hashtable -> crud, access, remove
6. Tree -> only BST, crud, parent node, left/right child how to access, how to traverse just left side, how to traverse just right side, DFS, BFS
7. Heap -> minHeap, maxHeap, crud
8. Graph -> basic graph theory, basic operations, crud
