What is a Git SSH Key?
    . An SSH key is an access credential for the SSH (secure shell) network protocol.
    . SSH is used for remote file transfer, network management, and remote operating system access.
    . SSH Uses a pair of keys to initiate secure handshake between remote parties.
    . The key pair contain `public` & `private` keys.
    . Think `public key` as a lock & `private key` as a `key`.
    . you give the `public lock` to remote parties to encrypt or lock data.
    . This data is then opened with the `private key`.
