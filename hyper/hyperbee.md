3. Blockchain Indexing (Efficient data retrieval)
4. Distributed Caching & Data Replication

# Questions and answer.
1. https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperswarm/rpc
    * RPC: is a Remote Procedure call.
    * One client/peer exposes a function & other peers call that function.
    * Real-Life Example of @hyperswarm/rpc is P2P Chat App using RPC.
    * They expose a sendMessage() function that others can call.
    * @hyperswarm/rpc (Remote Procedure Calls over P2P)
        ðŸ“Œ Role: Allows peers to call functions remotely over a P2P network without a central server.
        ðŸ“Œ Analogy: Think of WhatsApp voice messages. You send a request ("Hey, what's the weather?"), and the other person (peer) responds.
        ðŸ“Œ Real-world use case: Fetching crypto prices from a decentralized network without relying on a central server.
        ðŸ“Œ Example:
            1. A peer asks another peer: "Give me Bitcoin's latest price" (RPC call).
            2. The other peer fetches the data and responds.

2. https://docs.pears.com/building-blocks/hyperbee
    * Distributed Key value store.
    * built on TOP of hyper core
    * It has a persistent storage by default.
    * Hyper-bee is a decentralized key value store, unlike redis is centralized.
    * Hyperbee (Key-Value Database for P2P Apps)
        ðŸ“Œ Role: A fast and efficient key-value database built on top of Hypercore.
        ðŸ“Œ Analogy: Think of Google Drive. You store files (data) using a key (filename) and can retrieve them later.
        ðŸ“Œ Real-world use case: Storing crypto prices, messages, or user data in a P2P way instead of using a central database like MongoDB or MySQL.
        ðŸ“Œ Example:
            1. Key: "bitcoin"
            2. Value: { price: 50,000, timestamp: 1710000000 }
            3. Later, you can search "bitcoin" and get its latest price.

3. https://docs.pears.com/building-blocks/hypercore
    * Hypercore is a secure, distributed append-only log, meaning you can only add new dataâ€”you cannot modify or delete old data.
    * This structure is similar to how blockchains store transactions in sequential blocks.
    * Append-Only Log (Like a Blockchain)
        1. Hypercore is append-only, meaning you can only add new dataâ€”you cannot modify or delete old data.
        2. This structure is similar to how blockchains store transactions in sequential blocks.
        3. Example:
            1. Imagine a diary where you keep adding new pages but never erase past entries. Thatâ€™s how Hypercore works.

    * Distributed Log (P2P Data Sharing)
        1. Hypercore lets multiple peers store and sync logs without relying on a central server.
        2. Each peer gets a cryptographic key to verify the integrity of the data.
        3. Example:
            1. Imagine a Google Doc that updates in real time, but instead of Googleâ€™s servers, itâ€™s shared directly between users.

    * No Consensus (Unlike Blockchain)
        1. Unlike blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum), Hypercore does NOT use mining or consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
        2. Instead, each user decides which logs they trust.
        3. Example:
            1. Bitcoin needs mining to validate transactions. Hypercore skips this and just shares logs securely without requiring network-wide agreement.

    * Real-Life Analogy
        1. Think of Hypercore as a group chat where messages are shared in order:
            1. You can only add new messages (append-only).
            2. Everyone receives updates in real time (P2P sync).
            3. Thereâ€™s no moderator or central serverâ€”everyone verifies messages themselves.

    * Hypercore (Append-Only Log for Storing Data)
        ðŸ“Œ Role: A decentralized storage system for appending (adding) data like logs, messages, or versioned files.
        ðŸ“Œ Analogy: Think of Google Docs History. You keep adding new versions, but you never overwrite old data.
        ðŸ“Œ Real-world use case: Storing sensor logs, chat messages, or crypto transaction history in a P2P system.
        ðŸ“Œ Example:
            1. Every time Bitcoin's price changes, a new entry is added (not overwritten).
            2. You can track past prices without modifying history.

4. https://docs.pears.com/building-blocks/hyperdht
    * HyperDHT is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) Distributed Hash Table (DHT) used for peer discovery and routing in the Hypercore Protocol ecosystem.
    * Think of HyperDHT as a decentralized address book for finding and connecting to other users without relying on a central server.
    * Imagine you want to chat with friend online using whatsapp.
        1. You send message to Your friend.
        2. Message goes to WhatsApp's Central server.
        3. The server check for IP address of your friend.
        4. The server forward your message to friend.
        5. Problem: If WhatsApp server goes down, then you can't communicate.
        6. HyperDHT removes the central server and lets devices find each other directly:
        7. You store your unique key (like a username) in a decentralized network.
        8. Your friend looks up the key in the DHT and finds your deviceâ€™s location (IP address).
        9. The message is sent directly, without any company in between.
        10. No central server required!

    * HyperDHT (Peer Discovery â€“ "Decentralized Phone Book")
        ðŸ“Œ Role: Helps peers find each other on the network, similar to a decentralized DNS.
        ðŸ“Œ Analogy: Think of a phone book or Truecaller. Instead of knowing an IP address, you just use a username (or public key) to connect.
        ðŸ“Œ Real-world use case: Instead of looking up google.com â†’ IP, you ask HyperDHT, and it gives you a peerâ€™s location.
        ðŸ“Œ Example:
            1. Instead of IP addresses, you connect using a public key.
            2. You say: "I want to talk to the crypto-data-provider", and HyperDHT helps find them.

5. https://www.npmjs.com/package/hp-rpc-cli
    1. hp-rpc-cli is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with Hypercore-based RPC services.
    2. It allows sending and receiving RPC over P2P Network.
    3. It is built on Hyper-swarm.
    4. Instead of using GET, POST it send cmd directly to peer using CLI.

    * hp-rpc-cli (Command Line Tool for RPC Calls)
        ðŸ“Œ Role: A CLI tool for testing RPC calls without writing code.
        ðŸ“Œ Analogy: Think of Postman for testing APIs but for Hyperswarm RPC instead.
        ðŸ“Œ Real-world use case: If you build an RPC server that provides crypto prices, you can test it using hp-rpc-cli instead of writing a full app.

6. The Beast: HyperSwarm.
    1. Hyper-swarm is a peer-to-peer (P2P) networking library.
    2. That allows devices to discover and connect without a central server.
    3. HyperDHT = Phone Book ðŸ“– â†’ You look up a personâ€™s phone number.
    4. Hyperswarm = WhatsApp ðŸ“² â†’ You type their name, and it connects instantly.
    5. HyperDHT helps you find a peer.
    6. Hyperswarm helps you connect and communicate with the peer.

    * HyperSwarm
        ðŸ“Œ Role: Manages connections between peers automatically.
        ðŸ“Œ Analogy: Think of WhatsApp Groups. You join a group, and it automatically connects you to others in that group.

        ðŸ“Œ Real-world use case:
            1. Multiplayer gaming (like P2P Minecraft servers).
            2. Chat apps where users connect directly, not through a central server.

        ðŸ“Œ Example:
            1. If 5 people are tracking Bitcoin prices, Hyperswarm ensures they stay connected.
            2. If one leaves, the network remains stable.

# How They Work Together?
    1. HyperDHT: Finds peers (like a phone book).

    2. Hyperswarm: Connects you to peers automatically.

    3. Hypercore: Stores historical price logs.

    4. Hyperbee: Stores latest price data in a key-value format.

    5. Hyperswarm RPC: Allows remote function calls (e.g., "fetch Bitcoin price").

    6. hp-rpc-cli: Lets you test RPC calls easily.

# Real-World Example: Decentralized Crypto Price Tracker
    1. HyperDHT finds the peer that stores Bitcoin prices.

    2. Hyperswarm connects you to that peer.

    3. Hypercore/Hyperbee stores price history and latest prices.

    4. Hyperswarm RPC lets clients call "getLatestPrice".

    5. hp-rpc-cli allows testing from the command line.
