We can debug js code using this.

`The Node. js Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is an interactive shell that processes Node. js expressions. The shell reads JavaScript code the user enters, evaluates the result of interpreting the line of code, prints the result to the user, and loops until the user signals to quit.`
