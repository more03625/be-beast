# Containers:
    * An isolated env for running an application.
    * We can run 100s of containers side by side.
    * Are lightweight.
    * Start quickly.
    * Need less hardware resource.

# VM:
    * Is a abstraction of actual hardware.
    * Each vm needs a full os.
    * Slow to start.
    * Resource intensive. booting like normal computer. it takes time.
    * Limit on how many VM we can use on our computer.
