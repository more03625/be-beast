-- We use alises to give a temp name to column OR to table.
-- Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
-- You can create Alises with `AS` keyword.
-- You can also use Alises to make code shorter.

-- Example:
    -- SELECT CustomerID as ID FROM ProductTable;

    -- SELECT CustomerID as ID, CustomerName as Name FROM ProductTable;

    -- SELECT CustmerName, CONCAT(Adress, PostalCode, City, Country) AS Address FROM Customers;

    -- SELECT * FROM Customers AS Consumers.
